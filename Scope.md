# Project Scope #

The aim of this project is to provide a system wherein the physical difficulties encountered by disabled people at indoor and outdoor areas in everyday life, such as steep stairs or rough roads, can be recorded and audited by volunteers.

This project is non-profit and favours accessibility for every type of user.

The recording process of the difficulties will be performed via an Android-based mobile application. The auditing process thereof will be available on both the mobile application as well as on web.
