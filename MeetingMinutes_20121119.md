## Meeting decisions - 19rd November, 2012 ##

### To-do for the week ###

1. The development issues mentioned in the previous meeting (http://code.google.com/p/swe-574-group2/wiki/MeetingMinutes_20121117) will be created in the Google Code page and assigned to the relevant project members.

2. Different users should be able to add new comments to an existing entry and to see the comments of other users. So, a new intermediary db table (EntryComment) will be created.

3. Wording of the web site should be corrected (i.e. not "olumlu oy" and "olumsuz oy" but a more appropriate word should be used).

4. In the initial opening of the home page, all of the entries will be shown on the map. When clicked on the markers for these entries, category and child category data should also be displayed in the marker info window.

5. Codes for the mobile platform should be committed to SVN source.

6. Web site CSS issues should be corrected.

7. Users should be able to add deeper details such as "rampa eÄŸimi 15 derece" and the system should know how important this violation is. Thus, priorities for different kinds of violations should be determined.
